# React Boilerplate with Bcrypt Authentication

This boilerplate provides a simple and secure foundation for building a full-stack React application with user authentication using Bcrypt. The project includes a back-end server using Express and a front-end application built with React. The boilerplate includes user login and signup features, as well as middleware to protect routes and user data.

## Features

- React front-end application
- Express back-end server
- Sequelize ORM with PostgreSQL database
- User authentication using Bcrypt
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user session management
- Admin middleware to protect admin-specific routes
- User middleware to protect user-specific data
- Environment variables for sensitive information

## Get Started

- Fork & clone the repository to your local machine:
  `git clone https://github.com/your-username/bcrypt-boilerplate.git`
  `cd bcrypt-boilerplate`

- Create a PostgreSQL database:
  `createdb bcrypt-boilerplate`

- Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following variables:
  `JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret`
  `ADMIN_PASSPHRASE=your_admin_passphrase`
  Replace your_jwt_secret and your_admin_passphrase with your own secret values.

- Install the required dependencies:
  `npm install`
- Seed the database:
  `npm run seed`
- Start the development server:
  `npm run start-dev`

The application will now be running on http://localhost:3000.

## Customization

To adapt this boilerplate for your own project, you can start by customizing the front-end components and adding new features as needed. You may also update the back-end routes and models to handle additional data or requirements specific to your application.

Happy coding!
